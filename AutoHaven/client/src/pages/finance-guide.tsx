        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">1. Determine Your Budget</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Assess Your Finances:</strong> Start by reviewing your monthly income and essential expenses (rent, utilities, groceries, etc.). Identify a realistic amount you can allocate for car payments, including extra costs such as insurance, maintenance, and fuel.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Consider Interest Rates and Loan Terms:</strong> Your credit score will affect your auto loan interest rate. Use online calculators to estimate monthly payments for different loan terms (e.g., 36, 48, or 60 months). If you have limited credit history, you might need a co-signer or specialized financing options available for international students.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Explore Financing Options</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Bank or Credit Union Loans:</strong> Check local banks and credit unions for competitive rates and special offers for first-time buyers.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Dealership Financing:</strong> While convenient, compare dealership financing offers with other options as they might have higher interest rates.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Online Lenders:</strong> Many online lenders offer a fast pre-approval process. Read reviews and compare APRs carefully before making a decision.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>International Student Programs:</strong> Look for lenders and dealerships that offer programs specifically designed for international students lacking U.S. credit history. You might need additional documentation such as visa details or proof of enrollment.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Tip:</strong> Get pre-approved for a loan before you start shopping. This not only sets your budget but also gives you leverage when negotiating with dealers.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">3. Research and Choose the Right Car</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>New vs. Used:</strong> Decide if a new car with warranties and the latest features suits your needs, or if a used car with lower upfront costs is a better option. Consider factors like depreciation, fuel efficiency, and long-term reliability.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Vehicle History:</strong> For used cars, always request a detailed history report (e.g., via Carfax or AutoCheck) to check for previous accidents or repairs.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Test Drives and Inspections:</strong> Schedule test drives to assess the car's performance and comfort. If buying used, have a trusted mechanic perform a pre-purchase inspection.
        </p>
        <p className="mb-4">
          <strong>Insurance Considerations:</strong> Contact several insurance providers for quotes based on your potential car model. Insurance costs can vary significantly between new and used vehicles.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Documentation You’ll Need</h2>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
          <li>
            <strong>Driver’s License:</strong> A valid driver’s license is required. International students may initially use an international driving permit along with their home country license.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proof of Income or Funds:</strong> Lenders will need proof of income such as recent pay stubs, bank statements, or an employment letter.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Proof of Address:</strong> Provide documents like a utility bill or bank statement to verify your current residence.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Credit Information:</strong> If you have an established U.S. credit history, it will be used to assess your loan eligibility. Otherwise, be ready to demonstrate financial reliability through alternative documents.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Co-Signer (if needed):</strong> A co-signer with a strong credit record can help secure better loan terms if your credit history is limited.
          </li>
        </ul>
